# Weather-App

## The Mission

You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.  
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.

### Specifications

#### ðŸŒ± Must haves

-   In the home page the user can enter the city of their choice 
-   On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days

> ðŸ’¡ Not sure where to start? Split this features into multiple smaller todos (in your code, sketch, ...)

#### ðŸŒ¼ Nice to haves (in no specific order)

-   Remember the user choice on subsequent visits
-   Allow the user to compare the weather in multiple cities simultaneously
-   Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form.
-   Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as Chart.js
